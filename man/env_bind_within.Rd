env_bind_within(.env, ...)

\value{
The updated version of the environment \code{.env}, invisibly.

\description{
Like \emph{rlang}'s \code{env_bind} family of functions, this function also
takes named values and binds them to the specified environment, but also
evaluates the expressions in the environment. This has implications when
defining functions, because the encapsulating environment becomes the
input environment, not the caller environment.
}
\examples{
library(rlang)
e1 <- env()
e2 <- env()
env_bind(e1, f = \(x) x^2)
env_bind_within(e2, f = \(x) x^2)
fn_env(e1$f)
fn_env(e2$f)
}
