\item{variable}{Is this variable continuous, discrete, or mixed?}

\item{parameters}{Vector of unquoted variable names acting as the

\description{
Initiate a distribution object.
}
\details{
This function sets up a distribution object with high-level
information about the distribution. You can add / modify information about
the distribution downstream using the \verb{set_*()} family of functions.

This becomes the global environment for the function, so that when an object
is needed to be evaluated, it ultimately looks here.
