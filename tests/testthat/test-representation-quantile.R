#' @srrstats {G5.7} The only algorithm thus far is the quantile algorithm,
#' and its performance has been tested to take longer with a smaller
#' tolerance.
#' @srrstats {G5.8d} Data outside of the scope of the (quantile) algorithm
#' is only applicable when the quantile probability is outside of [0, 1],
#' in which case an error is thrown (due to a check for valid function
#' inputs).
#' @srrstats {G5.4} Correctness tests are conducted to test that
#' statistical algorithms (calculating properties from other distribution
#' properties) produce expected results to test distributions with set
#' parameters.
#' @srrstats {G5.4b} Implementations of existing methods (cdf, density, ...)
#' are compared against the stats package where possible. Implementations
#' like the hazard function that are not found in the stats package are
#' implemented formulaically and verified by comparing to algorithm based
#' on the representation's definition.
#' @srrstats {G5.6} Parameter recovery is relevant when distributional
#' properties (like quantiles) are computed from other properties (like the
#' cdf); these are possible to validate by comparing the intrinsic version
#' of the property against the derived version as if it were absent. See,
#' for example, `test-representation-density.R` (copied there).
#' @srrstats {G5.6a} Parameter recovery tests are conducted using the default
#' tolerance in the `testthat::expect_equal()` function whenever tests of
#' user-facing outputs are evaluated.
#' @srrstats {PD4.3} Tests of optimisation or integration algorithms
#' compare derived results from built-in results for permutations of
#' every distribution parameter.
#' @srrstats {PD4.4} Tests of optimisation or integration algorithms
#' compare derived results with algorithms in the stats package (e.g.,
#' quantile algorithm compared to `stats::q*()` functions).
