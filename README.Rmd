With `distionary`, you can:

1. Specify a probability distribution ([built-in](./articles/specify-built-in.html) or [your own](./articles/specify-user-defined.html)), and
2. [Evaluate](./articles/evaluate.html) the probability distribution.

The main purpose of `distionary` is to implement a distribution object, and to make distribution calculations available even if they are not specified in the distribution's definition. `distionary` provides the building blocks of the wider [`probaverse` ecosystem](https://probaverse.com) for making representative statistical models.

The name "distionary" is a portmanteau of "distribution" and "dictionary". While a dictionary lists and defines words, `distionary` defines distributions and makes a list of common distribution families available. The built-in distributions act as building blocks for the wider probaverse.

## Statement of Need

When building statistical models, distributions should accurately reflect your data, but out-of-the-box options like the Normal or Poisson distributions often fall short. Achieving realistic probability distributions demands a versatile workbench where distributions can be manipulated, and data can inform their features. This is the goal of the `probaverse` ecosystem, with `distionary` providing the foundational building blocks.

`distionary` provides the fundamental `probaverse` infrastructure for defining probability distribution objects. It allows for the evaluation of distribution properties, even if they aren't explicitly specified, offering standalone utility for users needing to define a distribution in various forms and evaluate it comprehensively.

## Target Audience

Lots of people work with probability distributions. Lots of people _don't_ work with probability distributions but should, because they don't see the value or because distributions are too clumsy to work with under existing infrastructure. And, there are lots of people learning about probability distributions that would have an easier time if they get to "feel" distributions and their multifaceted nature. `distionary` is for all of these people.

`distionary` -- and the `probaverse` more widely -- is designed for data scientists, statisticians, and researchers who require the flexibility to develop custom statistical models. It caters to those in finance, insurance, environmental science, and engineering, where nuanced distribution modeling is crucial. Whether building complex stochastic models or performing detailed risk assessments, `distionary` equips users with the tools needed to explore and manipulate probability distributions effectively.

`distionary` makes reference to common terms regarding probability distributions. If you're uneasy with these terms and concepts, most intro books in probability will be a good resource to learn from. As `distionary` develops, more documentation will be made available so that it's more self-contained.

## Installation

`distionary` is not on CRAN yet. You can download the development version from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("probaverse/distionary")
```

## Example: Built-in Distributions

```{r}
library(distionary)
```

**Specify** a distribution like a Poisson distribution and a Generalised Extreme Value (GEV) distribution using the `dst_*()` family of functions.

```{r}
# Create a Poisson distribution
poisson <- dst_pois(1.5)
# Inspect
poisson
```

```{r}
# Create a GEV distribution
gev <- dst_gev(-1, 1, 0.2)
# Inspect
gev
```

Here is what the distributions look like, via their probability mass (PMF) and density functions.

```{r}
plot(poisson)
plot(gev)
```

**Evaluate** various _distributional properties_ such as mean, skewness, and range of valid values.

```{r}
mean(gev)
skewness(poisson)
range(gev)
```

Properties that completely define the distribution are called _distributional representations_, and can be accessed by the `eval_*()` functions. such as the PMF or quantiles. The `eval_*()` functions simply evaluate the representation, whereas the `enframe_*()` functions place the output alongside the input in a data frame or tibble.

```{r}
eval_pmf(poisson, at = 0:4)
enframe_quantile(gev, at = c(0.2, 0.5, 0.9))
```

## Example: Custom Distributions

You can create a custom distribution using `distribution()`. The innovative aspect of `distionary` is its ability to automatically compute properties from the specified representations. By providing just one or two representations (such as CDF and density), `distionary` can derive other properties as needed.

```{r}
# Make a distribution by specifying only density and CDF
linear <- distribution(
  density = function(x) {
    d <- 2 * (1 - x)
    d[x < 0 | x > 1] <- 0
    d
  },
  cdf = function(x) {
    p <- 2 * x * (1 - x / 2)
    p[x < 0] <- 0
    p[x > 1] <- 1
    p
  },
  .vtype = "continuous",
  .name = "My Linear"
)
# Inspect
linear
```

Here is what it looks like (density function).

```{r}
plot(linear)
```

Even though only the density and CDF were specified, other properties can be evaluated, like its mean and quantiles:

```{r}
mean(linear)
enframe_quantile(linear, at = c(0.2, 0.5, 0.9))
```

## `distionary` in the Context of Other Packages

The R ecosystem offers several packages for working with probability distributions, each with unique strengths:

- **`stats` Package**: Provides fundamental functions for standard distributions but lacks a unified object-oriented approach for complex manipulations.
  
- **`distr` Package**: Introduces an object-oriented framework for distribution objects using S4, offering flexible manipulation, though it can be complex to extend and use.

- **`distributions3` Package**: Utilizes S3 classes for a straightforward interface focused on simplicity, suitable for basic tasks but may not meet advanced application needs.

- **`distributional` Package**: Extends `distributions3` to support vectorized operations, aiding statistical modelling but lacking extensive tools for custom distribution creation.

In this landscape, `distionary` addresses the need for a cohesive and flexible API that can seamlessly integrate the strengths of these packages. It provides a unified framework for defining, manipulating, and evaluating probability distributions. Because `distionary` only needs some distribution properties to be specified, it offers a level of flexibility central to the `probaverse` ecosystem.
