distionary:

1. Makes standard probability distributions available, like Normal, Poisson, and empirical distributions.
2. Provides a framework for you to construct your own distributions.
3. Evaluates probability distributions, even when not explicitly defined in the distribution object.

## Installation

distionary is not on CRAN yet. You can download the development version from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("vincenzocoia/distionary")
```

## Example

```{r}
library(distionary)
```

You can make distributions from standard families found in the `stats` package, like the Poisson distribution, along with a few others, like the Generalised Extreme Value (GEV) distribution.

```{r}
# Create a Poisson distribution
poisson <- dst_pois(1.5)
# Inspect
poisson
```

```{r}
# Create a GEV distribution
gev <- dst_gev(-1, 1, 0.2)
# Inspect
gev
```

Distributional representations can be viewed using the `plot()` function. Here is the GEV density function, for example.

```{r}
plot(gev)
```

Evaluate various distributional representations, such as the density or quantiles:

```{r}
eval_density(gev, at = -4:4)
eval_quantile(poisson, at = c(0.2, 0.5, 0.9))
```

Or, we can enframe the results in a tibble, keeping the input alongside the output.

```{r}
enframe_pmf(poisson, at = 0:4)
```

Evaluate properties of the distributions.

```{r}
mean(gev)
skewness(poisson)
range(gev)
```

You can make your own distribution, too. 

```{r}
# Make a distribution.
linear <- distribution(
  density = function(x) {
    d <- 2 * (1 - x)
    d[x < 0 | x > 1] <- 0
    d
  },
  cdf = function(x) {
    p <- 2 * x * (1 - x / 2)
    p[x < 0] <- 0
    p[x > 1] <- 1
    p
  },
  .vtype = "continuous",
  .name = "My Linear"
)
# Inspect
linear
```

Even though only the density and CDF are defining the distribution, other properties can be evaluated, like its mean and variance.

```{r}
mean(linear)
variance(linear)
```

Even other representations can be evaluated, such as quantiles or the hazard function.

```{r}
enframe_quantile(linear, at = c(0.2, 0.5, 0.9))
eval_hazard(linear, at = c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3))
```
