distionary:

1. makes standard probability distributions available, like Normal, Poisson, and empirical distributions -- and even your own distribution, and
2. provides a framework for evaluating probability distributions.

The distionary package is more useful when augmented with the [distplyr](https://distplyr.netlify.app) package, which provides a grammar for distribution manipulation. 


## Installation

distionary is not on CRAN yet. You can download the development version from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("vincenzocoia/distionary")
```

Or, install [distplyr](https://distplyr.netlify.app), and distionary will come along with it. 

## Example

```{r}
library(distionary)
```

We can make distributions from standard families, like beta and Poisson:

```{r}
(d_beta <- dst_beta(2, 4))
(d_pois <- dst_pois(1.2))
```

We can also make empirical distributions from data:

```{r}
x <- c(4.1, 2.3, 3.4, 5.5, 1.0, 6.8)
(d_emp <- dst_empirical(x))
```

We can evaluate different distributional forms, such as the density or pmf:

```{r}
eval_density(d_beta, at = c(0.1, 0.2))
eval_pmf(d_pois, at = c(1, 1.5, 3))
```

Or, we can enframe the results in a tibble:

```{r}
enframe_cdf(d_beta, d_pois, d_emp, at = c(0.1, 0.6, 1.5, 3))
```

Evaluate properties of the distributions:

```{r}
mean(d_beta)
skewness(d_pois)
range(d_emp)
```

You can make your own distributions, too. Want to make a distribution whose density decays linearly from 0 to `a`? Just ensure the `p`/`d`/`q` functions are available:

```{r}
# dlinear <- function(x, a) (a - x) / (a^2 / 2)
# plinear <- function(x, a) x * (a - x / 2) / (a^2 / 2)
# qlinear <- function(p, a) a * (1 - sqrt(1 - p))
# (my_dst <- dst_parametric("linear", a = 3, .variable = "continuous"))
```

Hazard function:

```{r}
# plot(my_dst, "hazard", from = 0, to = 3)
```

Mean:

```{r}
# mean(my_dst)
```
