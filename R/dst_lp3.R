#' Log Pearson Type III distribution
#'
#' Makes a Log Pearson Type III distribution, which is the
#' distribution of the exponential of a random variable following
#' a Pearson Type III distribution.
#'
#' @param meanlog Mean of the log of the random variable; single numeric.
#' @param sdlog Standard deviation of the log of the random variable;
#' single positive numeric.
#' @param skew Skewness of the log of the random variable;
#' single numeric.
#' @returns A Log Pearson Type III distribution.

#' @srrstats {PD3.0} *Manipulation of probability distributions should
#' very generally be analytic, with numeric manipulations only
#' implemented with clear justification (ideally including references).*
#' This only applies to the Pearson Type III and Log Pearson Type III
#' that manipulates the Gamma distribution from the stats package analytically.
#' User-facing manipulation is the job of the `distplyr` package in the
#' probaverse family. --> Copied to `dst_lp3.R`.
#' @srrstats {G2.0} Assertions on lengths of inputs (asserting that
#' inputs expected to be single- or multi-valued) are explicitly
#' tested for distribution parameters; implicitly through evaluation
#' functions.
#' @srrstats {G2.0a} Explicit secondary documentation of expectations on
#' lengths of inputs have been provided where relevant. See `dst_norm()`
#' for an example.
#' @srrstats {G2.1} Assertions on types of inputs is conducted using the
#' checkmate package for most functions.
#' @srrstats {G2.1a} Explicit secondary documentation of expectations on
#' data types of all vector inputs are provided. See `dst_norm()` for an
#' example.
#' @srrstats {G2.2} Prohibiting or restricting submission of multivariate
#' input (i.e., distributions) to univariate parameters is
#' done using the checkmate package for relevant functions (e.g., `dst_*()`
#' specifications)
#' @srrstats {G2.4} Mechanisms to convert between different data types is
#' bypassed by requiring strict type inputs (except integer, which is allowed
#' to be integerish).
#' @srrstats {G2.4b} Explicit conversion to continuous via `as.numeric()`
#' is avoided in case character input is provided; and error is thrown if the
#' input is not numeric, using the checkmate package.
#' @srrstats {G2.6} distionary asserts one-dimensional input where required
#' (e.g., `dst_*()` specifications) using the checkmate package.
#' @srrstats {G2.13} Checks for missing data are conducted for distribution
#' parameters and a Null distribution is made to handle missing data.
#' See `dst_norm()` for an example. Checks are made for built-in
#' representations, but the onus is on the user for self-defined
#' distributions.
#' @srrstats {G2.15} Functions never assume non-missingness, and never
#' pass arguments to another function with `na.rm = FALSE`-type parameters.
#' This is most relevant for functions like `dst_norm()`.
